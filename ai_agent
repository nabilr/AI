### **How Rational Agents Make Decisions**  

A **rational agent** makes decisions using a structured approach based on its perception of the environment, goals, and available actions. The decision-making process involves the following **five key steps**:

---

### **1. Perceiving the Environment**  
- The agent **collects data** using sensors (cameras, microphones, databases, APIs, etc.).  
- **Example:** A **self-driving car** detects road signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles using sensors and cameras.

---

### **2. Understanding the Current State**  
- The agent **processes the percepts** to understand what is happening.  
- If the environment is **partially observable**, it uses a **model** to infer missing information.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **chess AI** tracks the board's current state and opponent's last move.  
  - A **robot vacuum** maps the layout of the room and remembers where it has cleaned.

---

### **3. Evaluating Possible Actions**  
- The agent **considers all possible actions** and their consequences.  
- If it is **goal-based**, it checks which actions bring it closer to the goal.  
- If it is **utility-based**, it calculates which action maximizes the utility function.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **chess AI** simulates multiple future moves and selects the one leading to checkmate.  
  - A **self-driving car** considers multiple routes and selects the one with the shortest time and lowest risk.

---

### **4. Selecting the Best Action (Decision Making)**  
- The agent chooses the **most rational action** based on:  
  - **Performance Measure** (goal achievement, efficiency, safety, etc.).  
  - **Environment Rules** (laws, constraints).  
  - **Probability of Success** (especially in uncertain environments).  
- **Example:**  
  - A **shopping recommendation AI** suggests the best products based on user preferences and trends.  
  - A **stock trading AI** chooses to buy/sell based on real-time market data.

---

### **5. Executing the Action and Learning from Feedback**  
- The agent **performs the chosen action** using effectors (mechanical movements, API requests, text output, etc.).  
- It then **receives feedback** and **updates its model** for future decisions.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **self-driving car** avoids a sudden pedestrian and **learns** to slow down near crosswalks.  
  - A **spam filter AI** analyzes new emails and **improves its classification** of spam vs. non-spam.
